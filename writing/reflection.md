Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

The purpose of breaking the program into function is to let you develope and debug indivdual parts which helps makes your more efficent.


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

I validated user input in my version of rock paper scissors by checking if their input was in a list of acceptable inputs, and if it was it allows it to go through, and if not then it promts the user to input a new value. Input validation is important because if the user inputs data the program isnt expecting, it is prone to raising an error.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

I used comments and docstrings in my code by describing what each block of code within my functoins does and describing it's actions. An example of a helpful comment I wrote is "# compares winner to the only 3 values it should be".

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

The computer's move is generated in my program by putting in an list of all choice into the function random.choices(list), as it returns a random value from the list. The Python feature I used to accomplish this is importing.

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

The hardest challenging of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program was seeing where code that was needed for one function ended, and where another began. I overcame this challenge by rewriting some of the code to work within the function.

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

It is important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain is because it allows others to work on your code and take over development if you move onto different projects.

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response:

The ethical considerations one must take when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others is the concern of palgrism and learning how to credit everyone who help develop the program thoughout it's history.
